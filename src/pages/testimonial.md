Sabina gives wonderful guidance whenever needed. 
She's the one I can look up to in my hour of need and receive 
help. Her predictions have always amazed me by far. 
I am saying this because I met five astrologers, 
and nobody gave me any hope to face the situation 
and trouble I was going through. Sabina brought peace to 
my mind, helped me and guided me with effective and easy
 remedies. Sabina was God sent and she helped and guided
 me unconditionally. I could not see my daughter, who was 
a topper, sinking academically. Situation was so tough that 
there was a moment when we felt that our daughter might 
have to drop a year. But after sharing my problem with 
Sabina, I would say that her guidance and remedies changed 
my daughter’s future and today she got admission in one of
 the topmost universities of India.Finally, I would like to thank Sabina for the wonderful support and personal advice. Her              predictions have been very helpful and I know I can count on her for putting things into perspective and guide unconditionally.  ~ **POOJA MALHOTRA**

I have been taking Sabina’s guidance since the past 10 years on all my properties. Every time I need to remodel or buy a new property, I know I can trust Sabina with her immense knowledge on Vastu. Thanks for your help and guidance all these years.

Sabina has been like a God sent messenger. I remember the night when I had a major fight with my spouse, I was very depressed and suicidal that day. Sabina asked me to do some chants and the fight miraculously dissolved. Thank you Sabina
