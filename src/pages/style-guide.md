																									**VAASTU**

The literal meaning of Vastu is science of architecture. Vastu takes into account the knowledge of gravitational and magnetic field, velocity of winds and the effect of ultraviolet rays in designing structures. Structures built on Vastu principles are filled with positive energy and form a protective shield for the inmates and aids in their positive growth. Vastu has nothing to do with any religion or religious belief. 

I have been engaged in the study and implementation of Vastu principles since 2003. Over the years I have guided thousands of homeowners as well as businesses in designing & remodeling their spaces to live a more healthy and happy life. My experience has strengthened my belief that a healthy environment supports our growth and well being.

It also helps in the understanding of difficult phases and making the right decisions. It helps on a psychological plane too in easing off many tensions and turbulences if one is going through. Pre- requisite for Astrological Consultations are Date, Time and Place of Birth.

Following are the broad areas for Astrological Consultations:

**1. Birth Chart Analysis:**

A marriage compatibility report helps those who are about to get married or already married and having complications in married life. An analysis of the birth chart both boy and girl determines if the match is made for each other, has to put in efforts to understand each other or is completely in-compatible. 

###### DOWSING:
Dowsing consultations help in determining how the energies under the earth are effecting a human beings well being. Dowsing identifies the sources of negativity or geo-pathic stress in a premise. If for example the geopathic stress is identified running under the bed of a couple or their kids it has the potential to make the people sick. If in an office scenario the geopathic stress is found under the table or chair of the employees or employer it will hamper the work productivity in that office. Dowsing is a pro-active method of eliminating the source of negative energies which can affect the overall well being of human being.
