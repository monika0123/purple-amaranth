###### VAASTU

The literal meaning of Vastu is science of architecture. Vastu takes into account the knowledge of gravitational and magnetic field, velocity of winds and the effect of ultraviolet rays in designing structures. Structures built on Vastu principles are filled with positive energy and form a protective shield for the inmates and aids in their positive growth. Vastu has nothing to do with any religion or religious belief. 

I have been engaged in the study and implementation of Vastu principles since 2003. Over the years I have guided thousands of homeowners as well as businesses in designing & remodeling their spaces to live a more healthy and happy life. My experience has strengthened my belief that a healthy environment supports our growth and well being.

###### ASTROLOGY

Astrology is the study of forecasting the effects of planets and other celestial bodies like the Sun, Moon and Stars on humans. The birth chart of an individual is like a road map of his journey on earth and can be an incredible tool for self-discovery. Astrology acts like a link between humans and the universe and the birth chart an important key to help us understand our past, present and future events. Analysis of birth chart helps us in showing the right direction like a guru or teacher. Astrology is neither superstition nor regressive. It is a tool that helps us understand ourselves and our journey on earth. 

I have been studying Vedic Astrology and reading horoscopes since 2010. I have helped people not only deal with their challenges but also overcome their fears. Birth chart is a great tool to understand the ups and downs of life and be mentally strong. Every birth chart is designed in such a way that it presents both good and bad times. My role is to interpret the different phases and guide my clients how to maintain balance and positivity during tough as well as good times.

###### TAROT

The word Tarot is an Italian word which means Ta -Royal, Rot - Road or the Royal Path. Tarot originated in the Medieval Europe during the 1600's and is a form of Divination which helps us understand our past, connects it with our present and helps us better our future. Tarot gained popularity during the Victorian age when the study and research of Sub Conscious mind was as important as Science and Technology. Just like Vastu and Astrology Tarot too is a guidance tool and has nothing to do with miracles, spells or supernatural powers. 


I started studying Tarot in 2017 and use the Rider Waite deck to guide people. Based on the feedback from my clients I'm happy to say that they have benefited in making wiser and informed decisions.
