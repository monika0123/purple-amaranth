##### What is Vastu: 
Vastu is an ancient science of building structures based on the study of directions and the laws of nature. It combines these two important aspects and accordingly aligns a property to draw the maximum benefits for the inhabitants. Though vastu was essentially restricted to building temples however in the later decades it was used to build all kinds of properties or structures. A proper knowledge of the gravitational field, the magnetic field, velocity of winds and the ultraviolet rays helps in designing structures that are full of positive energy and therefore form a protective shield which helps in the growth of the inhabitants. Vastu has nothing to do with any religion or religious belief.

###### How Vastu Works: 
Vastu works on a simple philosophy of treating the house like a human body. A healthy body and mind reaps good and positive results. There is clarity of thought and therefore the body works with full energy and vitality. On the other hand an ailing body which does not have any energy or strength and is dependent upon medication can hardly function properly. A house or a structure built according to Vastu principles is healthy and produces positive results. It protects its inhabitants and brings all round growth. Therefore it is imperative that the foundations of any structure should be strong and healthy. If the structure is not built keeping vastu principles in mind it will degenerate bringing all kinds of miseries and afflictions.
