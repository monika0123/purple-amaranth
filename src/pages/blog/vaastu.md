The literal meaning of Vastu is science of architecture. Vastu takes into account the knowledge of gravitational and magnetic field, velocity of winds and the effect of ultraviolet rays in designing structures.

Vastu has nothing to do with any religion or religious belief.

Over the years I have guided thousands of homeowners as well as businesses in designing & remodeling their spaces to live a more healthy and happy life. My experience has strengthened my belief that a healthy environment supports our growth and well being.
