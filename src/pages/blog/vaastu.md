The word Tarot is an Italian word which means Ta -Royal, Rot - Road or the Royal Path. Tarot
originated in the Medieval Europe during the 1600&#39;s and is a form of Divination which helps us
understand our past, connects it with our present and helps us better our future. Tarot gained
popularity during the Victorian age when the study and research of Sub Conscious mind was as
important as Science and Technology. Just like Vastu and Astrology Tarot too is a guidance tool
and has nothing to do with miracles, spells or supernatural powers. 

I started studying Tarot in 2017 and use the Rider Waite deck to guide people. Based on the
feedback from my clients I&#39;m happy to say that they have benefited in making wiser and
informed decisions.
