The word Tarot is an Italian word which means Ta -Royal, Rot - Road or the Royal Path. Tarot originated in the Medieval Europe during the 1600's and is a form of Divination which helps us understand our past, connects it with our present and helps us better our future. Tarot gained popularity during the Victorian age when the study and research of Sub Conscious mind was as important as Science and Technology. Just like Vastu and Astrology Tarot too is a guidance tool and has nothing to do with miracles, spells or supernatural powers.

I started studying Tarot in 2017 and use the Rider Waite deck to guide people. Based on the feedback from my clients I'm happy to say that they have benefited in making wiser and informed decisions.
