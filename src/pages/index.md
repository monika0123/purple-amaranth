          **What is Vastu**: 

          Vastu is an ancient science of building structures based on the study
          of directions and the laws of nature. It combines these two important
          aspects and accordingly aligns a property to draw the maximum benefits
          for the inhabitants. Though vastu was essentially restricted to
          building temples however in the later decades it was used to build all
          kinds of properties or structures. A proper knowledge of the
          gravitational field, the magnetic field, velocity of winds and the
          ultraviolet rays helps in designing structures that are full of
          positive energy and therefore form a protective shield which helps in
          the growth of the inhabitants. Vastu has nothing to do with any
          religion or religious belief.



          **How Vastu Works**: 

          Vastu works on a simple philosophy of treating the house like a human
          body. A healthy body and mind reaps good and positive results. There
          is clarity of thought and therefore the body works with full energy
          and vitality. On the other hand an ailing body which does not have any
          energy or strength and is dependent upon medication can hardly
          function properly. A house or a structure built according to Vastu
          principles is healthy and produces positive results. It protects its
          inhabitants and brings all round growth. Therefore it is imperative
          that the foundations of any structure should be strong and healthy. If
          the structure is not built keeping vastu principles in mind it will
          degenerate bringing all kinds of miseries and afflictions.



          **Vastu Drishti and Vastu**: Vaastu Drishti believes in providing
          proper vastu guidance and helping people overcome their problems. The
          knowledge and experience of Vastu garnered over the years should be
          utilized in spreading awareness about the benefits of vastu and
          building structures that are beneficial for the coming generations.
          Vaastu Drishti has been engaged since 2003 in studying various
          structures with regards to vastu defects and rectifying them. A deep
          and proper understanding of the subject has helped in the correction
          of vastu defects and in turn helped the inmates enjoy a peaceful,
          stable and positive life. Vaastu Drishti has a vast experience in the
          field of vastu, has worked in designing various vastu compliant
          structures, rectified already built structures and used the knowledge
          of vastu to even cure sick and ailing structures.
